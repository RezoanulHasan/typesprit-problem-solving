//Utilize various TypeScript utility types like Partial, Readonly, Record, Pick, Omit, Exclude, Extract, and Required to manipulate the properties of objects.

//Showcase the practical application of these utility types for object modifications. Demonstrate how each utility type modifies the properties or creates new types by example, such as making properties optional, read-only, picking specific properties, excluding or extracting types, and requiring certain properties.

//this problem aims to illustrate the dynamic use of TypeScript utility types for altering the structure and properties of objects, providing an understanding of how these utilities are applied to enhance type definitions.
